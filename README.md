# **Excel Program for Phone Shopping Bot**

## **Introduction**

This Excel program is designed to provide an interactive user experience, similar to how UI applications prompt users for input and display results. It asks for information such as the userâ€™s preferences, then returns relevant links in a small box one by one, providing a smooth and efficient way to find and shop for phones.

## **Why Do We Need This?**

In today's fast-paced world, people prefer convenience and efficiency while shopping online. This Excel program automates the process of gathering phone shopping preferences from the user and displaying corresponding phone links, allowing users to make informed decisions faster. It eliminates the need for manual browsing and allows users to quickly compare options.

## **Tools Used**

- **Microsoft Excel**: The primary platform for the program.
- **VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**: Used for automating tasks and creating the interactive user interface.
- **Links**: The program pulls relevant shopping links based on the user's preferences, providing quick access to phone options.

## **How to Start Using This Program**

### **1. Setting Up the Excel Program**

1. Open the provided Excel file.
2. Press `Alt + F11` to open the VBA editor.
3. Paste the VBA code in a new module if not already done.
4. Close the VBA editor by pressing `Alt + Q`.

### **2. Running the Program**

- The program will start by asking the user for their preferences, such as the type of phone they are looking for.
- It will then provide relevant shopping links one by one in a small box within the Excel sheet.

### **3. User Interaction**

The program will prompt the user for specific information:

1. **What type of phone are you looking for?**
   - The user will input their preferences (e.g., budget, features).
   
2. **Which brands do you prefer?**
   - The user will select their preferred brands.
   
3. **What is your price range?**
   - The user will enter the minimum and maximum price they are willing to spend.

After collecting this information, the program will search for the relevant links and display them in a small box.

### **4. Viewing Results**

- Once the user provides the necessary information, the program will output a list of relevant links, one by one, in a small box.
- Each link corresponds to a phone that matches the user's preferences.
  
## **How the Program Works**

1. **User Input**: 
   - The program asks the user for specific preferences such as phone type, brand, and price range.
   
2. **Data Collection**: 
   - Based on the user's inputs, the program collects data (e.g., product details, prices, links) that matches the preferences.
   
3. **Display Results**:
   - The relevant links are displayed one at a time in a small box on the Excel sheet, making it easy for the user to click and view the phone options.

## **Features**

- **User-friendly interface**: The program interacts with the user step by step.
- **Customizable**: The program can be easily customized to include different types of products, brands, or categories.
- **Automated Process**: The user only needs to input their preferences once, and the program handles the rest.

- **Phone 1**: [Link to Phone 1](https://example.com/phone1)
- **Phone 2**: [Link to Phone 2](https://example.com/phone2)
- **Phone 3**: [Link to Phone 3](https://example.com/phone3)

Each link will be displayed in a small box, and the user can click on it to view more details.
